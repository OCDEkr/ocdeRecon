# pentui

A terminal user interface (TUI) that wraps and **automates** command-line
offensive-security tools, built for a cybersecurity department running authorized
penetration tests. Its purpose is to reduce manual input by chaining tools into
workflows — one tool's output automatically feeds the next.

**Nmap is the proof of concept.** The architecture treats every tool as a
pluggable manifest, and every multi-tool process as a definable workflow.

> ⚠️ For **authorized** security testing only. Engagements define explicit scope;
> out-of-scope targets are never scanned.

See [`PROJECT.md`](./PROJECT.md) for the full specification and architecture.

## Status

Phase 1 — a tool can be configured from a YAML manifest and run from the TUI with
live output streaming (sudo handled for root-only options). Result normalization
(Phase 2) and workflow orchestration (Phase 4) are not built yet. See
`PROJECT.md` §16 for the roadmap.

## Quick start (development)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

pentui                 # launch the TUI (placeholder in Phase 0)
pytest                 # run tests
ruff check . && mypy src
```
